\section*{Abstract}

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Personal Financial AI Agent---a machine learning-based system designed to provide intelligent, personalized financial guidance to users. The system leverages large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to deliver contextualized financial advice, portfolio recommendations, and analysis. The agent supports multiple LLM providers, namely Ollama for local offline inference, Google Gemini for cloud-based solutions, and OpenAI for industry-standard capabilities, enabling users to choose between privacy-first approaches and feature-rich cloud solutions. A Streamlit-based web interface facilitates interactive conversations in multiple languages, providing an accessible entry point for diverse user bases. The system demonstrates proficiency in financial profile extraction from natural language conversations, comprehensive portfolio analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations for scenario planning and risk assessment. This comprehensive study details the system's architecture, implementation techniques, evaluation methodologies, and provides clear demonstration procedures for practitioners and researchers. The project showcases the practical application of conversational AI and retrieval-augmented generation in the financial advisory domain, demonstrating how modern AI techniques can democratize access to quality financial guidance.
